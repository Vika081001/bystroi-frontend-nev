# Next.js Email Client

This is an email client template built with Next.js and Postgres. It's built to show off some of the features of the App Router, which enable you to build products that:

- Navigate between routes in a column layout while maintaining scroll position (layouts support)
- Submit forms without JavaScript enabled (progressive enhancement)
- Navigate between routes extremely fast (prefetching and caching)
- Retain your UI position on reload (URL state)

**Demo: https://next-email-client.vercel.app**

## Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/leerob/next-email-client
cd next-email-client
pnpm install
```

## Running Locally

Use the included setup script to create your `.env` file:

```bash
pnpm db:setup
```

Then, run the database migrations and seed the database with emails and folders:

```bash
pnpm db:migrate
pnpm db:seed
```

Finally, run the Next.js development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the app in action.

## Usage

Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README.

## Support

Tell people where they can go to for help. It can be any combination of an issue tracker, a chat room, an email address, etc.

## Roadmap

If you have ideas for releases in the future, it is a good idea to list them in the README.

## Contributing

State if you are open to contributions and what your requirements are for accepting them.

For people who want to make changes to your project, it's helpful to have some documentation on how to get started. Perhaps there is a script that they should run or some environment variables that they need to set. Make these steps explicit. These instructions could also be useful to your future self.

You can also document commands to lint the code or run tests. These steps help to ensure high code quality and reduce the likelihood that the changes inadvertently break something. Having instructions for running tests is especially helpful if it requires external setup, such as starting a Selenium server for testing in a browser.

## Authors and acknowledgment

Show your appreciation to those who have contributed to the project.

## License

For open source projects, say how it is licensed.

## Project status

If you have run out of energy or time for your project, put a note at the top of the README saying that development has slowed down or stopped completely. Someone may choose to fork your project or volunteer to step in as a maintainer or owner, allowing your project to keep going. You can also make an explicit request for maintainers.
